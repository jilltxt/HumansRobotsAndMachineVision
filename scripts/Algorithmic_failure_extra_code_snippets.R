# This code filters out specific kinds of prediction and specific character traits.
# It is set for the Prediction_type to NOT be equal to Accurate, and 
# Age to be Child, which only returns one result from the test dataset.
# To find all accurate predictions, change the != (not equal to) to == (is equal
# to), or you can for instance change to (Prediction_type == "False passive") 
# to show all the false passive predictions. Similarly change the (Age == "Child")
# to change the traits you want to see.
